#### This directory has everything that you need for a full featured device!

When building, make sure that the core is made from six prims (including the root).

```
Link 1: oc_auth.lsl
Link 2: oc_dialog.lsl
Link 3: oc_rlvsys.lsl
Link 4: oc_settings.lsl
Link 5: oc_anim.lsl; oc_pet.lsl; <animation content if applicable>

Link 0 (root): oc_com.lsl; oc_root.lsl; <and all remaining programs>
```

The default link order doesn't have to be used, and there are no requirements for prim names, so don't worry about that, although if you want, you can put a custom name for your device in the root prim's description : )
