Wendy's OpenCollar Distribution is a collection of LSL scripts, and creative content, such as sounds, textures and animations. Below you will find all that you need to know about the terms and conditions for all the individual elements of this collection.

 
##### L S L S c r i p t s

Each LSL script is its own program and compiles individually. Most of the scripts are licensed under the [GNU General Public License, version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0), but some of the more recently developed scripts are, in their unmodified form, licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

You can learn which script has which license by looking at each script's individual copyright notice. There you can also find the names of the various authors who contributed to the particular script over the years, and in which distribution the script was included prior to its release in Wendy's OpenCollar Distribution, with a link to its history.

 
##### S o u n d s , P a r t i c l e s a n d T e x t u r e s

The creative content, that is linked in collar scripts as unique database identifiers, can be used freely, on condition that authorship is noted. This addresses all sounds and particle textures, which are either re-mixes of public domain resource, or original creations by Wendy Starfall, with the exception of the Chain particle texture, which is a modification based on original artwork by Grey Mars.
​
The textures and their unique database identifiers, that are part of graphical user interfaces, such as the AO or Remote HUDs, are original creations by Wendy Starfall, and may only be used in other products or derivative works with express permission.

The ~run utility animation is an upload of an original creation by Vanish Firecaster and may be used freely, on condition that his authorship is noted. The ~good and ~pet animations by Roenik Newell, the ~shock loop by Kabuki Ewing, as well as the ~crawl and crawl animations¹ by Misao Nakamura were utilized from public domain resource.

​​Whereas these items are not actually a part of Wendy's OpenCollar Distribution, they are often mistakenly understood as such.

​The many free collars that are available at Arcadia and Bondage and labeled as "OpenCollar Originals", can be passed on as gifts among friends, or for example within the context of a role play scenario among consenting partners, but they may not be re-sold for Linden Dollars, or real world currency.

Wendy continuously improved these collars over the years with texture tweaks, more economical primming, or modelling, and you might be able to considerably reduce your avatar render complexity when replacing a collar of the same style with a new one. Refactored models can be distinguished by having VariousArtists (the official OpenCollar full perm creative resource) as their creator.

As of early 2018 these collars have new animations added to them, which include single-frame variations of some of the exclusive poses² that are only available with collars that feature, in part or as a whole, the Virtual Disgrace™ premium content selection. These poses are for personal use, and you are also welcome to share them, but you may not sell them for Linden Dollars or real world currency.

​The free cuffs, that are sometimes included with free collars, are very similar to the Virtual Disgrace™ premium selection cuffs, with the exception that the free cuffs receive updates at a different time, and have fewer binding poses³ for the arms. Please see their [individual license text](https://www.opencollar.at/license-terms-for-the-virtual-disgrace-premium-cuffs.html) for details.

<sup>² Multi-frame variations of poses have been created by Ash Ellsberg and remain the property of VirtualDisgrace and its suppliers.</sup>
<sup>³ All binding poses have been created by Grey Mars and remain the property of VirtualDisgrace and its suppliers.</sup>
